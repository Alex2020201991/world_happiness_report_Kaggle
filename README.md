**The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll.**

**In this project, we are going to visualize how each aspect affects the overall idea of happiness.** 

**Our goal is to get answers to what people care most about when they talk about happiness.** 

**At the end we use Machine learning models as Linear regression, XGB Regressor and Random fores.**
